Getting To Know You!!

	If you were a superhero, what superpower would you like to have?

It depends on the situation. If I was actually trying to do good and help people then
I would want the power to heal. But I do think a really interesting power to have would
to be able to give people varying levels of itches just by thinking it. That way I could
just really inconvenience someone if they were annoying me without actually hurting them. 

	What name would you choose if you had to rename yourself?

Giorgio (but actually probably Amaya)

	What would you buy first if you were handed a million dollars?

A rug for my room

	What three things would you take with you to a desert island?	

1) a water truck 2) water 3) sunscreen

(don't worry, we're not doing anything with these responses, it's just for fun)
